# NinjaDark Installation Instructions

## For Your Coworkers

### Step 1: Download the Extension
Download the `ninjaDark-v1.0.zip` file that was shared with you.

### Step 2: Extract the ZIP
1. Right-click on `ninjaDark-v1.0.zip`
2. Select "Extract All..."
3. Choose a location you'll remember (like `Documents\ninjaDark`)
4. Click "Extract"

### Step 3: Install in Chrome
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files
5. Select the folder and click "Select Folder"

### Step 4: Verify Installation
1. You should see "NinjaDark" appear in your extensions list
2. Navigate to `https://app.ninjarmm.com`
3. The page should now have inverted grayscale colors (dark mode)
4. Colorful elements (status indicators, badges, alerts) should remain vibrant

### Troubleshooting
- **Extension not working?** Make sure you extracted the ZIP first (Chrome can't load directly from ZIP files)
- **Still seeing white background?** Click the refresh button on the extension card in `chrome://extensions/`
- **Colors look wrong?** Try refreshing the NinjaRMM page (Ctrl+F5)

## What It Does
NinjaDark automatically inverts white, black, and grayscale elements on app.ninjarmm.com while preserving colorful UI elements like status indicators and badges.
